# VideoGameFinalProject
My game is called Don't Make A Sound, and it's about surviving three rounds in a house alone with a creepy monster with skulls lined on his back, constantly looking for you. You have to hide in one of the four dedicated hiding spots, but forget to hide, or choose the wrong spot, and you're not gonna make it out of that house.
Controls:

W, A, S, D to move
Left shift to sprint
I've made no script changes, just made original scripts, however, any 3D models and fonts in this project were all found online. All my scripts can be found in this repository.
I'm most proud of my 3D evolution during this final project, this is one of the biggest game, if not the biggest game I've ever made.
There were a lot of challenges I encountered during this project such as lack of quality with jumpscare, coders block, and not knowing how to
continue the game.
